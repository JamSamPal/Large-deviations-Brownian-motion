# Loschmidt Echo
The idea of a Loschmidt Echo is to solve a PDE, here the heat equation, with the boundary condition that the initial
and final states are the same. This creates an interesting scenario where the diffusive spreading out of the heat equation
must be combatted by the need to return to its initial state.
