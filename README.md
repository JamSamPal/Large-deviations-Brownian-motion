# Introduction
This work numerically solves a PDE, the heat equation, with the initial state of a Gaussian pulse.

We will be interested in the tails of the probability distribution, that is the probabilities of rare events.
These tails will always be Gaussian in the absence of an external potential thus, for a more interesting problem,
we add one. We will consider multiple potentials in this work but begin with the simplest, a delta pulse centred
on the Gaussian initial state.
