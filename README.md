# Introduction
This work numerically solves a PDE, the heat equation, with the initial state of a delta pulse.

We will be interested in the tails of the probability distribution, that is the probabilities of rare events.
These tails take an interesting and analytically tractable form for a delta function potential. Such a potential
models herding in financial markets. We verify the analytics with a numerical result here.
